# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

This project was to refactor the code within the Horiseon landing page without altering the appearance of the page.

The goal was to add semantic elements for accessibility, making the code make more sense to myself as well as other developers, and overall cleaning up the syntax.

This project helped me learn how to write semantic code while still putting forward the same product. Being able to change the code to make more sense and have more accessibility while keeping the same appearance when deployed has helped my understanding of good coding ethic.
